# HashiCorp Get Start

In this repository, you will find the practical labs proposed by the HashiCorp initial training path. For all the labs, the playgrounds available on the A Cloud Guru platform were used, but the exercises are focused on using the free resources available in each of the providers used in the exercises.

There are also some other practical exercises that are not part of the HashiCorp Get Start path but help you to deepen some basic contents not covered in official training.

If you want to follow the training path, you can find it [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started).
