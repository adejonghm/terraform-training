# Terraform Training Path

<br/>

> :warning: DISCLAIMER <br>
I am not responsible for any fees charged by Providers when attempting to reproduce the labs.

<br/>

In this repository, you will find a series of practical laboratories I developed throughout the [Terraform - Do Básico ao Avançado](https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-do-basico-ao-avancado) course to learn how to use the terraform with Azure and AWS providers. All labs were deployed using my account from both providers. To avoid high costs, at the end of each laboratory, it is strongly recommended to destroy the infrastructure that was created, in this way, you will be able to reproduce each of the laboratories without having to pay anything.

There are also other hands-on that are part of HashiCorp's Get Started Training Paths that you can find in the branch `hashicorp`.
